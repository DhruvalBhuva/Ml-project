==> Machine learning types:
1) Supervised learning:
   - Classification: For binary predication (i.e: Yes/ No)
   - Regresion: For continues prediction (i.e: Temprature, sale predictioin)
   				- Requied continues data over the axis

2) Unsupervised learning:
   - Clustering
   - Association

3) Reinforcement lerning

==> Supervised Algo:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - KNN



==> Logistic Regrssion: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnOAdxOWXWg&list=PLEiEAq2VkUULNa6MHQAZSOBxzB6HHFXj4&index=2)
   - Threshold Value: After it more likey result
   - S curve ( sigmoid curve )
   - Used: i) Weather prediction :> - Is today rain or not
   								 - Is today sunny or not
   		   ii) Image classifiaction:> For it if there are multiple lables then need to change as, "is it dog or not, is it cat or not"
   		  iii) Number classification:  

==> Checking Accuracy:
  1) Confusion Matrix:
    - Used for classification algo
    - Diagonaly value are usefull, it shows correct prediction
  2) Mean square error:
    - 
    -
